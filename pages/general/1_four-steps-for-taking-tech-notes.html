        <p>In the world of software development, our day-to-day life revolves around identifying problems, referring to API docs, and sketching out solutions and diving in and implementing those solutions in code, then checking the results and learning from our blunders, and finally, making better informed decisions.</p>
        <p>So, this cycle can be broken down into four key stages:</p>
        <h3 id="1-identify-the-problem">1. Identify the problem</h2>
        <p>No matter if it is dealing with a bug, enhancing existing code, implementing new features, or facing issues, everything starts with identifying and understanding the problem. First of all, you should note down any specifics, such as: messages, stack traces, screenshots, and anything else that helps capture the essence of the issue.</p>
        <h3 id="2-research-possible-solutions">2. Research possible solutions</h2>
        <p>After identifying the problem, the next step is digging into potential solutions. This is where you should start exploring libraries, tools, forums, and/or related GitHub issues.</p>
        <h3 id="3-validate-those-solutions">3. Validate those solutions</h2>
        <p>Once you have researched the potential solutions, or even while you are still in progress of researching, it is time to roll up your sleeves and start implementing them to see what works and what does not and why.</p>
        <p>During this phase, your notes should become a dynamic coding journal, capturing snippets of code you might be trying and the output results and also the additional insights you gather along the way and so on. This record of your journey can be immensely helpful.</p>
        <p>Try to split this section in two parts: <strong><em>What worked well</em></strong> and <strong><em>What did not</em></strong>.</p>
        <h3 id="4-reuse-the-knowledge">4. Reuse the knowledge</h2>
        <p>Throughout he note-taking process, your notes at this point should have naturally become a robust knowledge base that can be reused for future projects. You can achieve this by inserting code snippets to your notes.</p>
        <h3 id="5-share-what-your-learned-optional-">5. Share what your learned (optional)</h2>
        <p>Note-taking should not only be for your personal reference. It would be a good practice to share what you learned with other by publishing content based in your notes.</p>
        <p>This is an excellent way to give back to the developer community, and also an opportunity to showcase your knowledge and skills with other people around the globe.</p>
        <h3 id="extra-notes">Extra notes</h2>
        <p>Remember, note-taking is not about being perfect. So write as freely as it were a sketchbook.</p>
        <p><strong>The most important thing of all of this, is to keep coding and writing.</strong></p>
