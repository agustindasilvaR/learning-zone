        <h3 id="what-is-data-analysis-">What is data analysis?</h3>
        <p>Data analysis consists of the process of identifying, cleaning, transforming and modelling data to discover meaningful and useful information.</p>
        <p>Our world day by day becomes more data-driving, so data analysis has become a vital component of both large and small businesses. This is the reason why organizations often hire data analysts.</p>
        <p>While the process of data analysis focuses on the tasks of cleaning modeling, and visualizing data, the concept of data analysis and its importance to business should not be understated. To analyze data, core components of analytics are divided into the following categories:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Descriptive</li>
        <li>Diagnostic</li>
        <li>Predictive</li>
        <li>Prescriptive</li>
        <li>Cognitive</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="descriptive-analytics">Descriptive Analytics</h3>
        <p>Descriptive analytics help answer questions about what has happened based on historical data. Descriptive analytics techniques summarize large datasets to describe outcomes to stakeholders.</p>
        <p>By developing key performance indicators (KPIs), these strategies can help track the success or failure of key objectives.</p>
        <p>Metrics such as return on investment (ROI) are used in many industries, and specialized metrics are developed to track performance in specific industries. </p>
        <p>An example of descriptive analytics is generating reports to provide a view of an organization’s sales and financial data.</p>
        <h3 id="diagnostic-analytics">Diagnostic Analytics</h3>
        <p>Diagnostic analytics help answer questions about why events happened.</p>
        <p>Diagnostic analytics techniques supplement basic descriptive analytics, and they use the findings from descriptive analytics to discover the cause of these events. Then, performance indicators are further investigated to discover why these events improved or became worse.</p>
        <p>Generally, this process occurs in three steps:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>Identify anomalies in the data. These anomalies might be unexpected changes in a metric or a particular market.</li>
        <li>Collect data that’s related to these anomalies.</li>
        <li>Use statistical techniques to discover relationships and trends that explain these anomalies.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3 id="predictive-analytics">Predictive analytics</h3>
        <p>Predictive analytics help answer questions about what will happen in the future. Predictive analytics techniques use historical data to identify trends and determine if they’re likely to recur. Predictive analytical tools provide valuable insight into what might happen in the future. Techniques include a variety of statistical and machine learning techniques such as neural networks, decision trees, and regression.</p>
        <h3 id="prescriptive-analytics">Prescriptive analytics</h3>
        <p>Prescriptive analytics help answer questions about which actions should be taken to achieve a goal or target. By using insights from prescriptive analytics, organizations can make data-driven decisions. This technique allows business to make informed decisions in the face of uncertainty. Prescriptive analytics techniques rely on machine learning as one of the strategies to find patterns in large datasets. By analyzing past decisions and events, organizations can estimate the likelihood of different outcomes.</p>
        <h3 id="cognitive-analytics">Cognitive analytics</h3>
        <p>Cognitive analytics attempt to draw inferences from existing data and patterns, derive conclusions based on existing knowledge bases, and then add these findings back into the knowledge base for future inferences, a self-learning feedback loop. Cognitive analytics help you learn what might happen if circumstance change and determine ow you might handle these situations.</p>
        <p>Inferences are not structured queries based on a rules database; rather, they’re unstructured hypotheses that are gathered from several sources and expressed with varying degrees of confidence. Effective cognitive analytics depend on machine learning algorithms, and will use several natural language processing concepts to make sense of previously untapped data sources, such as call center conversation logs and product reviews.</p>
