            <ul>
                <li><strong>KPI (Key performance indicators):</strong> measure which indicates a company’s success vs. a set of targets, objectives, or industry peers. <em>**</em></li>
                <li><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><em></em></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong><strong>ROI (Return of investment):</strong> the ratio of net profit over the total cost of investment.</li>
                <li><strong>Machine learning:</strong> a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science which focuses on the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way that humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy.</li>
                <li><strong>Neural network:</strong> a series of algorithms that endeavors to recognize underlying relationships in a set of data through a process that mimics the way the human brain operates.</li>
                <li><strong>Decision tree:</strong> non-parametric supervised learning method used for classification and regression.</li>
                <li><strong>Regression:</strong> a method for understanding the relationship between independent variables or features and a dependent variable or outcome.</li>
            </ul>    
            <li><a href="../../pages/data-analysis/2_roles-in-data.html"><h3>Roles in data</h3></a></li>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Data wrangling: </strong> process of converting raw data into a usable form. It may also be called data munging or data remediation. You’ll typically go through the data wrangling process prior to conducing any data analysis in order to ensure your data is reliable and complete.</li>
                <li><strong>Data warehouse: </strong>system used for the analysis and reporting of structured and semi-structured data from multiple sources.</li>
                <li><strong>Data lake:</strong> centralized repository designed to store, process, and secure large amounts of structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data.</li>
                <li><strong>Exploratory data analysis (EDA):</strong> analysis technique used by data scientists that refers to the critical process of performing initial investigations on data so as to discover patterns, to sport anomalies, to test hypothesis and to check assumptions with the help of summary statistics and graphical representations.</li>
                <li><strong>Forecasting model: </strong>statistical tool designed to predict future trends and outcomes based on historical data. It involves analyzing past patterns and trends to make informed predictions about future events, sales, demand, or inventory levels.</li>
                <li><strong>Deep learning:</strong> machine learning technique that teaches computers to do what comes naturally to humans: learn by example.</li>
            </ul>                
            <li><a href="../../pages/data-analysis/3_tasks-of-a-data-analyst.html"><h3>Tasks of a data analyst</h3></a></li>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cognitive Services:</strong> a set of machine learning algorithms that Microsoft has developed to solve problems in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI).</li>
                <li><strong>Data silo:</strong> collection of data held by one group that is not easily or fully accessible by other groups in the same organization.</li>
            </ul>
